You can find support for your work in
the Rackspace cloud
in many ways:

* `Support Home <https://support.rackspace.com/>`__
  offers frequently-needed support and startup information.

* `System Status <https://status.rackspace.com/>`__
  identifies alerts and disruptions.

* :how-to:`Rackspace How-To <>`
  publishes documentation primarily written for
  Cloud Control Panel users.

* :rax-docs:`API documentation, including release notes, developer guides, and
   getting started guides <>`

Many Rackspace pages
offer links to help you begin a live chat session or a telephone conversation.
:rax:`Contact Rackspace <information/contactus/>`
also provides links to help you submit support tickets.

Depending on which support tier you chose when creating your account, you
might also have direct access to a specific account support team.
