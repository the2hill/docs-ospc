Trying something new
--------------------
If you have never used a particular service before,
your first attempt to do so in the Cloud Control Panel
will remind you that you are beginning something new
and point out the first step that you should take.

When Rackspace makes a new service generally available,
all customers are given access to that service.
When a new service is made available to you,
its endpoint is added to the
:rax-dev-devguide:`service catalog <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#service-catalog-resource-authentication-response-attributes>`
that is returned when you authenticate before using an API or CLI.

If you meet eligibility criteria,
it might  be possible for you to experiment with a new service
before it is made available to all customers.
The
:rax:`Rackspace blog <blog/?s=early+access>`
is a good place to learn about
limited-access and early-availability releases;
signup procedures and contact information are included in
each announcement.
