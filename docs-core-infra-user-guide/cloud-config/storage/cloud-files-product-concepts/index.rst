Understanding Cloud Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Rackspace Cloud Files storage system provides a secure,
network-accessible way to store an unlimited number of files. Each file
can be as large as 5 gigabytes.

You can store as many files as you want
and only pay for the storage space you actually use.

Cloud Files also provides a simple yet powerful way to publish and
distribute content behind a content delivery network (CDN). As a
Cloud Files user, you get access to this network automatically.

Cloud Files enables you to store and retrieve files and CDN-enabled
content through a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) web
services interface. There are also language-specific APIs that use the
RESTful API and make it easy for integration into your applications.

         straightforward: authenticate, create a container, upload objects,
         mark the container as public, and begin serving that content
         from a powerful CDN.
