~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are a number of tools and extensions designed to help you manage
your Cloud Files. Following are a few of the available options:

* **Rackspace CDN** is a WordPress plug-in that allows any media
  in your WordPress uploads folder to be uploaded to
  Rackspace Cloud Files, powered by CDN. Once the file is uploaded,
  it is deleted from the local server. You can find more
  information about Rackspace CDN at `Rackspace Cloud Files CDN
  <https://wordpress.org/plugins/rackspace-cloud-files-cdn/>`__.
* **Django-Cloudfiles** is an extension to the management system
  of the website framework, Django. Django-Cloudfiles enables you
  to synchronize the static content delivery of your
  Django-powered website to your Cloud Files account. You can find
  Django-Cloudfiles at `GitHub <http://github.com/rossdakin/django-cloudfiles/>`__.
* **Media Manager** is a plug-in that will mirror your
  media library to your Cloud Files CDN. All URLs to this content
  use the Cloud Files path when you insert them using the
  Media manager. You can import all of your media to the CDN.
