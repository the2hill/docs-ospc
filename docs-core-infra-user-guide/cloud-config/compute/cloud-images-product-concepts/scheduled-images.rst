Scheduled images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In addition to on-demand images, you have the ability to enable
scheduled images on any servers for which the service is appropriate.
The scheduled images service automatically creates a daily or weekly
image of the server. Remember that a virtual machine image is not really
a backup of a server, so whether scheduled images are an appropriate
solution for you depends on your use case.
For more information, see the
:how-to:`Scheduled Images FAQ <scheduled-images-faq>` in Rackspace How-To.
