Sharing images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cloud images can be created as snapshots of a cloud server. They can
also be imported using the Cloud Images Import feature.

No matter how you create an image, you can share it from one
Rackspace cloud account to another, on an on-demand basis. This can be
useful for many scenarios:

* Share an image of a new server that you have created or customized with a
  colleague for testing and comments.

* If you have multiple cloud accounts at Rackspace, for example to
  support different internal organizations or company branches, you can
  create a single central image and then share it with other accounts
  so they do not have to create one themselves.
