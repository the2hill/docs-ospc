Image-sharing roles
+++++++++++++++++++
An *image producer* is also called an *image owner*.
An image owner can offer to
share an image with one or more *image consumers*.

An image consumer is also called an *image member*.

A *shared image* is an image that an image owner has made available
to one or more image members.

Image sharing is not a relationship of peers:

* The *possibility* of sharing is controlled by the image producer,
  who offers to share with a consumer.
* The *actuality* of sharing is controlled by the image consumer,
  who can accept or reject an offer to share.

As a reminder of this unequal relationship,
images are shared from producers *to* (not *with*)
consumers.
