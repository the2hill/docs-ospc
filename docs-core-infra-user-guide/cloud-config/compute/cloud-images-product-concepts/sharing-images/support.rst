Getting support for shared images
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Rackspace supports the images that we offer as base images.

In almost all cases, an image that is shared from a producer to
consumers is one that has been modified from a base Rackspace image or
is a custom image that has been imported.

This means that providing detailed support for modifications or
applications in the shared image might be beyond the scope of Rackspace
Support (for both Managed Infrastructure and Managed Operations
service levels). Rackspace will generally offer best-effort support
to verify whether any servers created from the images have
problems booting or other
issues, but detailed troubleshooting of any specific additional
functionality is the responsibility of the image producer.
