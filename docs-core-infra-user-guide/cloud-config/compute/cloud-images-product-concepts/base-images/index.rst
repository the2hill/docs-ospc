Creating cloud servers from base images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can create a cloud server from a cloud image that you created,
or you can create it from an image that Rackspace created.

We maintain the images that we create;
you are responsible for maintaining the images that you create.
