Patching base images
++++++++++++++++++++
Software patches are applied to base images as appropriate to each
operating system:

* Windows images are usually updated once per month, consistent with
  Microsoftâ€™s patch release cycle.

* Linux images are updated on an as-needed basis which varies from
  distribution to distribution.

Regardless of which operating system an image uses, critical patches are
applied to base images as soon as possible even if the change falls
outside of the usual update schedule.
