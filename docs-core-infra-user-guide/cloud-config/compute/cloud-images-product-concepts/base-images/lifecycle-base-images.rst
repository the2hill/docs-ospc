Base images life cycle
++++++++++++++++++++++
To provide the best experience for customers, we carefully maintain
the list of images that is displayed when you are building a new cloud
server. For example, older versions of an operating system are sometimes
removed from the default list, usually shortly after a newer version is
released.

Images that have been published are never deleted, so even if
they are removed from the default list they are still buildable via
the image ID when using the Cloud Servers API.

Older images that have been
removed from the default list are no longer maintained and might not
contain the most recent patches or package updates.
