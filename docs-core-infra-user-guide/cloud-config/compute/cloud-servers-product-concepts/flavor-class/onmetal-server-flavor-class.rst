You can choose OnMetal™ Server flavor classes optimized for I/O, memory,
or compute resources:

-  **OnMetal I/O** is optimized for
   large relational databases, noSQL data stores,and
   Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) applications.

   OnMetal I/O servers are
   designed to support low-latency and extreme throughput to local
   storage, using a pair of the fastest PCIe flash cards available.

-  **OnMetal Memory** is optimized for
   large-scale caches, index searches, and in-memory analytics.

   OnMetal Memory servers are
   designed for memory-intensive workloads such as Memcached and
   Redis. 512 GB servers and a low-latency 10 GB/s network enable modern
   architectures with the entire working set in RAM.

-  **OnMetal Compute** is optimized for
   high-traffic web servers, application servers,
   load balancers, and queue processing.

   OnMetal Compute servers are
   designed for connection handling and CPU-heavy workloads
   such as web serving.
   With high speeds, plenty of cores and a low-latency
   10 GB/s network, OnMetal Compute is perfect for rendering
   web pages or pushing packets.
