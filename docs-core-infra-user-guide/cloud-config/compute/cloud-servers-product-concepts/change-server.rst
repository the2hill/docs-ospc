Changing the characteristics of a cloud server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you create a cloud server with a certain flavor, the resources
that are assigned with the flavor are fixed.
You cannot create a server and then
change the amount of RAM or disk or CPU available to it. If you need a
server with a different set of resources, create a new server and
migrate your applications and data.
