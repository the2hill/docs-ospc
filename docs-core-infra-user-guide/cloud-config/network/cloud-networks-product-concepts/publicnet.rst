~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PublicNet in the cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rackspace PublicNet connects cloud infrastructure components such as cloud
servers, cloud load balancers, and network appliances to the Internet.

PublicNet is optimized for traffic flowing to and
from the Internet (north-south traffic). It follows a direct addressing model,
so all
public IP addresses are directly configured on the servers without being
Network Address Translated.

PublicNet is dual-stacked for IPv4 and IPv6. When you create a server
with PublicNet, your server receives an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address by
default.
