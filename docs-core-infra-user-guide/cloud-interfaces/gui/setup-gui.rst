Preparing to use the Cloud Control Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel, you need the following items:

* A Web browser
* A Rackspace account
* Credentials (username and password) giving you access
  to that account

Log in by going to the Cloud Control Panel's :mycloud:`login page <>`,
providing your credentials, and clicking **Log In**.

The account's credentials are those that were chosen when you,
or someone else on your account, created a Rackspace
cloud account.

If you do not have a Rackspace cloud account,
or if you have forgotten the account's credentials,
you can use the
:mycloud:`Need help logging in? <>`
or
`Join the Cloud Now <https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud/?cid=ccpl1>`__
links from the
:mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel's login page <>`
to get what you need.
