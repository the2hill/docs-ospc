Learning more about the Cloud Control Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every cloud account comes with access to the
:mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel <>`.
Depending on how you use your Rackspace account,
you might not be interested in changes to specific
Rackspace cloud products and services.
However, the Cloud Control Panel is common ground,
available to all Rackspace cloud customers,
and we recommend that all Rackspace customers pay attention
to ongoing development there.

Making yourself familiar with the following sites
and keeping up with new information there
will
help you become a skillful user of the Cloud Control Panel:

* **Technical documentation**
  focused on the Cloud Control Panel,
  including short tutorials and demonstrations, is
  published in :how-to:`Rackspace How-To <>`.

* **Announcements of major changes**
  are published
  in the
  :mycloud:`Release Notes <release_notes>`.

  .. note::
     We continuously improve the Cloud Control Panel, so
     you might see minor changes between visits.
     Only major changes are announced in the Release Notes.
