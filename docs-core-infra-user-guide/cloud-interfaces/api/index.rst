API: Developer and DevOps tools
-------------------------------

If you write applications that are tightly integrated with the Rackspace cloud, 
you might find that clicking to choose options in the Cloud Control Panel
and typing to issue commands with CLIs are not ideal for your purposes.

If you develop or distribute applications for your customers, or if you want to 
automate the operation of your cloud infrastructure, you might need to interact 
with cloud services by using API operations.

If you are responsible for administering systems that are used for cloud 
software development, you can investigate DevOps tools designed for this 
purpose.
