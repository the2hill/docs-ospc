Release notes announce new API features, bug fixes, and other changes.

For release notes that announce changes to the APIs, go to :rax-docs:`here <>`.
You can subscribe to an Atom feed for each API's release notes
so that you are notified when we update them.

You can also subscribe to a combined Atom feed for all API documents,
including API release notes, :rax-docs:`here <feeds/atom-all.xml>`.

You can learn how to use new features
and influence planned changes by talking with Rackers and
customers.

If you need to do so, raise an issue with `Rackspace support <https://support.rackspace.com/>`__.
