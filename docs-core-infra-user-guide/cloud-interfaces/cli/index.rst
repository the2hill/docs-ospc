CLI: Command-line interfaces and tools
--------------------------------------
If you want to manage your cloud configuration
by typing commands or executing shell scripts,
you can use command-line interfaces (CLIs)
provided by OpenStack and,
in some cases, supported by Rackspace. You can also use Rackspace's dedicated CLI
client, Rackspace CLI.
