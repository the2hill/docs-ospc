^^^^^^^^^^^
The OpenStack tool primarily used for
managing Cloud Networks is written
in Python and called *neutron*.
It is also known as
*python-neutronclient*.

We recommend that you use the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__
to install neutronclient, because it installs dependencies and
required packages for you.

Alternatively, you can download the ``rackspace-neutronclient`` package from
the
:rackerlabs:`GitHub repository for rackspace-neutronclient <rackspace-neutronclient>`.

The following OpenStack documents can help you install neutronclient
and learn to use it:

* :os-docs:`Install the OpenStack command-line clients <user-guide/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html>`

* :os-docs:`OpenStack Command-Line Interface Reference <cli-reference/content/index.html>`,
  especially at
  :os-docs:`Networking command-line client <cli-reference/content/neutronclient_commands.html>`

* :os-docs:`Python bindings to the OpenStack Network API <developer/python-neutronclient>`
