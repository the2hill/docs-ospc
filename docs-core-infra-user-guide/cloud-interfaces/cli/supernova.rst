If you work with multiple Rackspace regions, you might find *supernova*
to be particularly useful.
It simplifies the process of
providing credentials and connection information for multiple Rackspace
regions, so you can quickly interact with multiple regions
without changing
environment variables or configurations as you might need to do with
novaclient.

Although supernova is not officially supported by Rackspace, it is
heavily used and generally found to be stable and useful. You can
install supernova via PyPi, or download it as described in
`supernova's documentation <http://supernova.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.
