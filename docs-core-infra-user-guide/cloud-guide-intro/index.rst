How to use this guide
=====================
We created this guide to help you get the most from your Rackspace cloud
and especially from its core infrastructure:

* Cloud Servers

* Cloud Networks

* Cloud Images

* Cloud Block Storage

* Cloud Files

The guide is meant to simplify your startup process.
It doesn't replace the detailed technical documentation for these
services, but it should give you a clear picture of
what you can do in the Rackspace cloud.

* :ref:`cloud-intro`
  provides a high-level overview of our core infrastructure,
  explains how our cloud hosting differs from other kinds of hosting,
  gives a brief tour of Rackspace cloud services,
  and connects you to our collection of user stories.

* :ref:`cloud-interfaces` suggests several ways of
  controlling your configuration, including the GUI-based Cloud Control
  Panel and several CLIs, APIs, and SDKs.

* :ref:`cloud-config`, focuses on the core
  infrastructure, providing facts and suggestions to help you quickly
  establish a useful and manageable cloud configuration.

* :ref:`cloud-preprod` specifies pre-production steps you should
  take to harden your cloud server and make it ready for work.

* :ref:`cloud-ops` identifies ongoing
  responsibilities and suggests special-interest topics that may
  interest you after you are established in the cloud.
