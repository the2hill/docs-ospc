Assumptions

We wrote this guide for you, imagining "you" as someone who:

* **is already a Rackspace customer**

We want to help you understand what's available to you in the
Rackspace cloud. You might already be familiar with other
Rackspace products and services.

* **knows quite a lot about your own application**

We want to show you how your cloud configuration can
give you new ways to get your work done. You've already decided what
that work is.

* **works confidently with computing outside the cloud**

We haven't written an introduction to computing; if we use a term
and don't define it, that's because we're using it in an
industry-standard way that is clear to you
or easy for you to discover.

* **knows a little about cloud computing and now wants to know a lot
  about cloud computing at Rackspace**

We'll explain key ideas and how they relate to each other. Your
situation is unique, and we want to help you recognize topics to
investigate and options to pursue as you move your work into
the Rackspace managed cloud.

* **is willing to follow links from this brief guide to more detailed
  Rackspace resources**

We'll point you toward case studies, step-by-step tutorials, API
references, and more. As you get started in
the Rackspace managed cloud, learning to use supporting information
will help you become confident and successful.
