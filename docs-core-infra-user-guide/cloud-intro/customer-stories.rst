Customer stories
----------------
You have big ideas of your own, but thinking about what other customers
have accomplished in the Rackspace cloud may give you some new
inspiration. To learn about customers who have used the cloud to help them
meet some of the same challenges you are facing, explore the Rackspace
`Customer Stories <http://stories.rackspace.com/>`__ collection.
Within that collection, you may be able to find a story about a Rackspace
customer who is working in your industry, in your region, or with the
Rackspace product you want to learn about.

For example, at `Customer Stories <http://stories.rackspace.com/>`__,
pulldown the ``Product`` list and click ``Cloud Servers`` to see links to
several stories of customers who are using Cloud Servers to meet their
business challenges.

Other good places to learn about Rackspace customer stories
include:

* :rax-dev-blog:`Postings from Racker and customer developers in the Rackspace developer blog < >`
