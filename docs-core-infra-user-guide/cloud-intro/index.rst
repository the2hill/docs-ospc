Introducing the Rackspace cloud
===============================
Rackspace is the home of the #1 managed cloud, which provides you
with the best way to get your work done.

By using the Rackspace managed cloud, you can focus
only on your core business without worrying about building and
maintaining the cloud infrastructure. For more information
about what differentiates the managed cloud from other
business solutions, see
:rax:`What is managed cloud? <blog/what-is-managed-cloud/>`

The Rackspace public cloud is
bigger than the core infrastructure
that is the focus of this guide,
but you are likely to begin with the core infrastructure and then add
other products and services as you become increasingly familiar with
what is possible in the cloud.

* :ref:`core-infrastructure` summarizes the contribution
  of each of the
  cloud services in the core infrastructure.

* :ref:`context` identifies alternatives to the
  OpenStack-based Rackspace public cloud,
  all also based on OpenStack.

* :ref:`cloud-tour` introduces additional cloud services that you may find
  helpful in addition to the core infrastructure services.

* :ref:`customer-stories` suggests some of the ways in which
  Rackspace customers have put the Rackspace cloud to work for them.
