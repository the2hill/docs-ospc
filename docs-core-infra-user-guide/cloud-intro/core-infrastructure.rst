Rackspace cloud core infrastructure at a glance
-----------------------------------------------
Your Rackspace cloud configuration is backed by the physical
infrastructure in our
:rax:`data centers <about/datacenters>`.

The virtual infrastructure of the managed cloud is provided by
infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) software services that perform some
of the same functions as hardware devices in our data centers:

* Cloud Servers provides computing power.

* Cloud Networks creates an internal network of cloud servers.

* Cloud Block Storage emulates a removable disk, which can be
  transferred from one cloud server to another.

* Cloud Images preserves a consistent starting point for new Cloud
  Servers instances.

* Cloud Files provides long-term storage for an unlimited number
  of objects.

* Additional services enable specific activities such as user
  authentication, load balancing, and event monitoring.

         a cloud service.
         The service processes
