Cloud Feeds provides API access to events emitted from your infrastructure
resources.
With Cloud Feeds, you can track usage right now.
You can see *access events* (for example, who changed what server via control plane at what point) and
*state transition events* (for example, when did a load balancer's status go to 'draining').
