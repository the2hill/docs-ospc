The managed cloud in context
----------------------------
The Rackspace managed cloud, our public cloud, is built to comply with
the open-source :os:`OpenStack <>` specification.
We're a founder of OpenStack and we continue to contribute to its
ongoing development. When your workload runs in our managed cloud, it's
managed and supported by Rackers on Rackspace infrastructure in
Rackspace data centers. The flexibility of OpenStack backed by the
support of Rackspace is a unique and powerful combination; as a user of
our managed cloud, you can expect to benefit from that synergy.

If someday you choose to work with an OpenStack cloud
but prefer not to do so
within the Rackspace managed cloud, you can expect that transition to be
easy.
When you are a Rackspace customer
operating in the Rackspace managed cloud,
several alternatives are a short distance away:

* You can use our :rax-cloud:`Managed Private Cloud <private>`
  product to create
  and operate your own cloud on infrastructure managed by Rackspace.

* You can install OpenStack yourself, on your own equipment, and manage
  your own cloud with your own personnel on your own infrastructure.
  :os-docs:`DevStack <developer/devstack>` can
  help you quickly build your own OpenStack cloud, potentially
  :os-docs:`suitable for your internal software development <developer/devstack/faq.html#can-i-use-devstack-for-production>`.


* You can find another provider and use their OpenStack-compliant
  public cloud. The
  :os:`OpenStack Marketplace <marketplace/public-clouds/>`
  can help you identify other OpenStack cloud providers.
