==========================
Preparing for productivity
==========================
Before you begin performing useful work on a cloud server or any server,
your first activities on that server should to ensure that it is
secure, running necessary software, and regularly backed up. These are
good practices in or out of the cloud.

Because you probably chose to use
cloud computing to deal with a rapidly changing workload, it's important for
you to begin two additional good practices now to prepare you to
recognize and respond to usage peaks:

* Establish a monitoring protocol to alert you to unusual events
* Establish scaling policies to enable your configuration to grow as needed

.. NOTE::
   Securing your own server and establishing your own backups
   provides a layer of protection that you can control,
   in addition to the protection provided by Rackspace's reliable
   infrastructure. You can read about
   our infrastructure at
