.. _monitoring:

------------------
Observing activity
------------------
The Rackspace cloud infrastructure is meant to operate smoothly,
handling workload peaks with no human intervention. When unexpected
events happen, part of ensuring continued smooth operation is to make
sure a responsible human knows what's going on and can decide whether to
get involved. Before any surprises can happen, set yourself up for
success by using Cloud Monitoring to identify what events you want to
know about and how you want to be told.

If you are using Cloud Databases or are signed up for the Managed
Infrastructure service level, some Cloud Monitoring is already in place
for you. To investigate other options, begin with
