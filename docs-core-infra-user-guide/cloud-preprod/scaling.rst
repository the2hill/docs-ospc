------------------
Automating growth
------------------
The cloud gives you room to grow. Before growth surprises you, you can
establish some policies for handling it, using Auto Scale to add new
cloud servers when they're needed. Autoscaling policies are easy to
change as you become more familiar with the peaks and patterns in your
workload.

Auto Scale relies on Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Load Balancers. To learn
how to use Auto Scale through the Cloud Control Panel or the Cloud
Monitoring API, start at the
:how-to:`Rackspace Auto Scale introduction page <rackspace-auto-scale>`.
