.. note::
   Because the
   Cloud Control Panel
   uses APIs,
   watching the Cloud Control Panel work
   can help you learn how to work with APIs.

   To see how the Cloud Control Panel
   gets its information:

   * Launch the
     `Chrome browser <https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/>`__.
   * In Chrome, log in to your
     :mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel <>`
     account.
   * For Mac, from the Chrome menu, select **View > Developer > Developer Tools**.
     For Windows, from the Chrome menu, select **More tools > Developer Tools**.
   * Experiment in the Cloud Control Panel and observe
     the actions in Chrome's developer view.
