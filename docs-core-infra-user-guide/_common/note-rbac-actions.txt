.. NOTE::
   Rackspace technical documentation for each cloud service
   describes all the actions that can be performed with that
   service's public API.
   However, because role-based access control (RBAC)
   makes it possible to allow some users to perform actions that
   cannot be performed by other users,
   your ability to perform the actions listed here
   depends on
   the specific permissions granted to the ID you use.

   You can learn more about RBAC at
   :how-to:`Getting Started with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) <getting-started-with-role-based-access-control-rbac>`.
