.. note::  
   You can use OpenStack documentation 
   to help you learn to use OpenStack CLIs 
   in the Rackspace Cloud. 
   OpenStack documents describe general practice; 
   you should expect to supply some Rackspace-specific details.  
   Use your Rackspace credentials 
   where the OpenStack examples 
   ask for OpenStack credentials. 
   
   For example, 
   where you are asked for 
   ``OS_USERNAME``, 
   supply your Rackspace username.
