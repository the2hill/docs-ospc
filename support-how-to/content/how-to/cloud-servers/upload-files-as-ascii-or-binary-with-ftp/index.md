Deciding how you should upload a file depends strictly on the type of file.

The majority of FTP programs have an **Auto** mode that switches dynamically
between ASCII or binary upload modes depending on the type of file. If you use
the Auto feature, verify the list of ASCII file extensions of the FTP program.
The FTP program uploads any file not included in the list of ASCII extensions
in binary mode.

### ASCII mode

As a general rule when uploading a file, you should transfer in ASCII mode anything you
can view with a text editor. Also, upload files such as HTML, ASP, PHP, CGI, and PL in
ASCII mode.

### Binary mode

Transfer binary files, such as GIF or JPEG images, ZIP files, and executables in
**binary** mode.
