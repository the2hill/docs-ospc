You can use the `python-novaclient` command-line interface client (CLI) to control
OpenStack&reg; cloud server instances, including Rackspace Cloud Servers. The CLI
client provides a bit more functionality than the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com) without the need to delve
directly into the Application Programmer Interface (API).

The following links provide installation instructions for Windows&reg;, macOS X&reg;, and Linux&reg;:

-   [Install python-novaclient using pip](https://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/user-guide/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html)
-   [Install python-novaclient on Linux by using yum](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/10/html/command-line_interface_reference_guide/install_clients)

Find a list of common operations that you can perform with the
client in [Useful python-novaclient commands](/support/how-to/useful-python-novaclient-commands).
