##Project description
<!-- Provide as little or as much information about architecture as needed to help 
contributors figure out which file to update.-->

This project is developed and built using the [Python Sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/). 
Content is written in [reStructuredText](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html), the markup syntax and parser 
component of [Python Docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/index.html).

Source files for the Sphinx documentation project are in the ``api-docs`` directory. Here are the key files that 
define the Sphinx project and content architecture for the documentation:

output, or to the staging URL that Ash is working on. --> 

# Submitting changes

When you've completed your changes, submit a pull request. Someone on the Information 
Development team will review your PR.
- Minor updates and corrections get a quick review to ensure that content is error-free and 
  doesn't introduce other issues.
- More complex changes or additions require both technical and editorial review. 

Depending on the review feedback, you might be asked to make additional changes. 

After content has been reviewed and approved, the updates can be merged to the master branch. 
The merge triggers the build and deploy process. Typically, new content is available on 
developer.rackspace.com within a minute or two after it is merged. Larger updates might 
take a bit longer.

## Previewing changes

When you submit a pull request, the Strider build process creates a preview of your changes in a staging 
environment. After the build process completes, the following message displays in the pull request comments 
with a link to the content: ``Your content preview is now ready.`` 

You can also build the project locally using the [Sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

[Building from source](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/doc/tools/build-from-source.rst).
