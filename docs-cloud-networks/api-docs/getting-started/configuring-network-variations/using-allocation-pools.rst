Controlling dynamic IP address allocation by using allocation pools
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Allocation pools are a property of the ``subnets`` resource and can be used to
control dynamic address allocation within a CIDR.

An allocation pool is a subset of the CIDR. Any addresses that are not part of
the allocation pool are not dynamically assigned to ports or to server
instances. However, addresses that are not part of the allocation pool, but
that are within the CIDR, can still be assigned statically when a port is
created by using the ``fixed_ips`` attribute of the ``ports`` resource. The
port ID can then be passed to the server at boot time as shown in the example.

The following flow chart shows the steps for using allocation pools to control
dynamic IP address allocation. Detailed steps are provided in this section.
