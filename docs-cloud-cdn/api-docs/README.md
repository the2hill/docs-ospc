To contribute content, all you need is an editor and a 
basic understanding of the project layout and [reStructuredText](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html) syntax.

You can use the GitHub editor or any text editor to work with documentation source files. For quick syntax checking, try the 
[Online restructuredText editor](http://rst.ninjs.org/). 

**Note:** If you want to build the project, you need to install the [Sphinx documentation generator](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/install.html). 

## Source format

The Rackspace developer documentation is developed and built using the [Python Sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Content is 
written in [reStructuredText](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html), the markup syntax and parser component of 
[Python Docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/index.html).

The repository includes the documentation source files, 
Sphinx configuration and build files, as well any required Sphinx 
extensions and build tools.
