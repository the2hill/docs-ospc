What's new
----------

Rackspace CDN has been updated to allow HTTP traffic on an SSL
domain. Consequently, the description of the ``protocol`` parameter for
the request in the :ref:`create a service <cdn-create-a-service>` operation
has been changed. The statement that indicated that domains must use the same
protocol has been deleted.
