API |contract version| updates, August 26, 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What's new
----------

-  Cache invalidation has been added to the :ref:`purge a cached
   asset <cdn-purge-a-cached-asset>` operation through the
   ``hard`` query parameter. The default value for
   ``hard`` is set to ``false``, which does cache invalidation,
   while setting the value to ``true`` performs an actual purge.

-  The ``access`` attribute with valid values of ``whitelist`` and
   ``blacklist`` has been added to the ``restrictions`` parameter for the
   :ref:`create a service <cdn-create-a-service>` operation to allow or block
   access.

-  The ``request_url`` and ``client_ip`` attributes have been added to the
   ``rules`` parameter for the :ref:`create a service <cdn-create-a-service>`
   operation. These attributes enable restriction rules for URLs and IP
   addresses.

-  New services are now created with a default TTL
   for ``/*``. You see this default TTL in the ``rules`` section of the
   service.


Resolved issues
---------------

-  Fixed an issue to now disallow entering a root domain for the domain
   field in a service

-  Fixed an issue where now a TTL of 0 seconds is treated as “no-cache”
   with Akamai
