Listing all agents for the user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The agent is an important component of Cloud Backup. You must install
the agent on all servers that you want to back up. Documentation about
installing agents is available from the link on Rackspace Control Panel
under the **Backup** tab or at
:how-to:`Install the agent on Linux<rackspace-cloud-backup-install-the-agent-on-linux>`.
After the agent is installed on one or many servers, you can use the
Cloud Backup API to configure your backups.

..  note::
    If your account has the Managed Operations level of support, the Cloud
    Backup agent might already be installed on your server. If your cloud
    servers are listed under the **Systems** tab in theÂ \ **Backup** section
    of the Cloud Control Panel, then the Cloud Backup agent is already
    installed. If it is not, Rackspace can install it for you. Check with
    your account manager.

Assuming that you initially know nothing about the environment, in order
to do anything with the backups, you need to list the agents. After you
list them, you can choose the one you want to work with.
``MachineAgentId`` is what you need to work with the agent in other
requests.

The HTTP request must include a header to specify the authentication
token.

An HTTP status code of 200 (OK) indicates that the request succeeded.

**Example: cURL list all agents for the user request**

.. code::

   curl -s -X GET $API_ENDPOINT/v1.0/$TENANT_ID/user/agents \
   -H "X-Auth-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" | python -m json.tool

**Example: List all agents for the user response**
