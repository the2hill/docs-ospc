Delete a backup configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete the configuration file and verify that it was
removed.

The delete operation does not return a response body. An HTTP status code of
204 (No Content) in the response indicates that the request succeeded.

..  note::
    The environment variable ``$TENANT_ID`` in the cURL requests in the
    following examples represents the project ID.

**Example: Delete a configuration, cURL request**

.. code::

   curl -i -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v2/$TENANT_ID/configurations/yourConfigurationID \
   -H "X-Auth-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN"

To verify that the configuration is deleted, retrieve the
configuration details
(:ref:`Retrieve details for a configuration<get-list-details-about-a-configuration>`)
to see ``deleted: true`` in the response.
