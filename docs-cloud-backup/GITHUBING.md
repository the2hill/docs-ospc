# GitHub workflow :octocat:

To contribute content to this repository (repo), use the GitHub workflow described here. 
To follow the entire contribution process, go to 
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Note:** This workflow shows how to make changes to the repo from the command line by 
using git commands. If you do not want to use the command line, you can use GitHub Desktop 
or another GitHub GUI instead to accomplish the steps. 
  

## Prerequisite

* [Generate SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)

## Workflow

1. Create a fork of this repo.

2. Use the ssh URL for the forked repo to clone it to your local system.

    ```bash

    git clone git@github.com:my-github-username/docs-cloud-backup.git

    ```

3. Track the upstream repo
    
    ```bash
    cd docs-cloud-backup
    git remote add --track master upstream git@github.com:rackerlabs/docs-cloud-backup.git
    
    ```
    Start new changes with the following steps.

4.  Bring your branch up-to-date with upstream
   
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    ```

5. Create a branch for changes. For details about this part of the workflow, see 
   [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) 
   guide.
    
    ```
    bash
    git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
    ```

6. In the new branch, make changes to existing files and add new files, as needed. 

7. Add all files relevant to the change 
   
   ```
   git add .
   ```

8. Commit the changed files.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "The reason for my change"
    ```

9. Push your branch to your fork
    ```bash
    git push -u origin <name-of-branch>
    ```

10. Create a pull request (PR) to the upstream repo for your branch

    a. Go to https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-cloud-backup

    b. Click on the Create pull request button

    c. If this PR is related to an outstanding github 
      [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-cloud-backup/issues), include a link to that GitHub issue in the comment

11. The Information Development team will review your pull request. 

12. If necessary, incorporate changes from the review, make updates to your PR by adding 
    more commits.
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "The reason for my update"
    git push
    ```
13. Repeat step 12 as needed. 

14. Resolve conflicts, if necessary.

    During your review process, someone might have already updated and merged a file that 
    you are in the process of changing. . Such a conflict means that you canâ€™t merge your 
    PR. To resolve the conflict, perform the following steps. 
    
    a. Bring your branch up-to-date with the upstream repo by running the following 
       commands from your branch:
       
       ```
        git fetch upstream
        git rebase upstream/master
       ```
    
    b. Follow the steps to [resolve a merge conflict from the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/).

15. When content is approved and you have resolved any conflicts, the Information Development team will merge your pull request. 

16. Update your repo

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push
    ```
