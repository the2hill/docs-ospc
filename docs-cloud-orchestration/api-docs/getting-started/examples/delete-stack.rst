---------------------------------------

Delete your stack `Single-Server-Stack` by issuing the following
command:

.. code::

     heat stack-delete Single-Server-Stack

The command returns the following information for the stack:

.. code::

   +--------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------===-+----------------------+
   | id                                   | stack_name          | stack_status       | creation_time        |
   +--------------------------------------+---------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
   | 3bd2c230-b02a-45d8-9f16-88c9a9f64d2d | Single-Server-Stack | DELETE_IN_PROGRESS | 2014-01-23T19:41:05Z |
   +--------------------------------------+---------------------+--------------------+----------------------+

(:ref:`list-stacks`) and observe that the `Single-Server`Stack` is not
listed.
