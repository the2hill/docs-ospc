.. _update-stack-lb:

Updating a stack with a load balancer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section you send a request to update your stack by adding a
load balancer to use with the two servers.

  1. Make a copy of the ``servers-with-lb.template`` file from the previous
     section, and name the copy ``servers-with-lb-add.template``.

  2. Add the load balancer to the ``servers-with-lb-add.template`` file
     by adding the highlighted text in the following example.

.. code::

       Heat Orchestration Template that spins up a
       resource group with 2 cloud servers
       and a cloud load balancer.

     resources:
       web_nodes:

           protocol: HTTP

           virtualIps:
           - type: PUBLIC
             ipVersion: IPV4

     outputs:
       lb_public_ip:
         description: The public IP address of the load balancer
         value: { get_attr: [lb, PublicIp]}

In the `description` section, you added the information that the
template now also creates a load balancer.

For the `lb` resource (in the `resources` section), you added the information
to create the load balancer. The resource type
is `Rackspace::Cloud::LoadBalancer`. The load balancer has the
following properties:

  * It is named `LB-Compute` load balancer.

  * It defines a list of `addresses` for the back-end nodes by calling
    the `get_attr` intrinsic function, passing it the name of the
    resource group (`web_nodes`) and the IP address for each
    server resource (`accessIPv4`), as defined in the resource group.
    These back-end nodes are the servers that you created in
    :ref:`create-stack-resource-group`. Each node uses port 80, and all
    nodes are enabled.

  * The load balancer protocol is HTTP and the service is defined on port 80.

  * One public IPV4 virtual IP address should be added for the load balancer.

.. note::
   To create a ServiceNet address for the load balancer instead of a
   public virtual IP address, use the following value for ``type`` instead:

   .. code::

        - type: SERVICENET

   You will also need to change the outputs as follows:

   .. code::

        outputs:
          lb_servicenet_ip:
            description: The Servicenet IP address of the load balancer
            value: { get_attr: [lb, virtualIps, 0, address ]}

   Since `virtualIps` is an array, you need to request the `address`
   in the first element of the array (array subscript 0) to get
   the Servicenet address.

  * A health monitor is defined with the following attributes set:

      * `attemptsBeforeDeactivation` - Number of attempts made before the node
        is removed from the rotation

      * `delay` - Number of seconds to wait before executing the health
        monitor

      * `timeout` - Number of seconds to wait for a connection to be made
        before timing out

      * `type` - Type of the health monitor

      * `path` - HTTP path used in the monitor request

      * `statusRegex` - Regular expression used to evaluate the HTTP status
        code returned in the response

      * `bodyRegex` - Regular expression used to evaluate the contents of the
        body of the response

The `outputs` section defines a single output `lb_public_ip`, which is the
public IP address for the load balancer. Its value is assigned to the
result of calling the `get_attr` intrinsic function with the name of the
resource (`lb`) and its attribute (`PublicIp`).

You can send the update request using either of the following methods:

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

.. _update-stack-heat:

Update a stack with a load balancer by using the heat client
------------------------------------------------------------

Issue the following command:

.. code::

     heat stack-update Servers-With-LB-Stack --template-file servers-with-lb-add.template

The command returns the information about the stack, including its
status `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS`:

.. code::

   +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
   | id                                   | stack_name            | stack_status       | creation_time        |

   +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+----------------------+


Wait a couple of minutes and then issue the following command:

.. code::

     heat stack-show Servers-With-LB-Stack


The command returns the details about the stack, including its
status `UPDATE_COMPLETE`:
