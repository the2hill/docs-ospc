Deleting a stack with a load balancer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are finished using your stack, delete it by using the commands
shown in :ref:`delete-stack`. Be sure to adjust the stack name
(and for cURL, the `stack_id`) as necessary to reflect the
new `Servers-With-LB-Stack` that you are deleting.

This concludes the Getting Started exercises.
