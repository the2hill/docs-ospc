The Rackspace Cloud Orchestration API service enables developers to automate
the creation of application environments on the Rackspace Cloud. Using the
API, developers can create, update and manage groups of cloud resources and
their software components as a single unit and then deploy them in an
automated, repeatable fashion via a template. On deployment, the Orchestration
services builds required cloud resources, installs all necessary software,
and configures the software according to Rackspace best practices,
delivering a fully-functioning application or framework ready for you to push
code or content to.
