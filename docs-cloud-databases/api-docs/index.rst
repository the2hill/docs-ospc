The Rackspace |product name| service
:rax:`powered by OpenStack <cloud/openstack/>` enables developers to
easily provision database instances of varying virtual resource
sizes without the need to maintain and/or update the database engine through
a simple Representational State Transfer (REST) web service interface.
