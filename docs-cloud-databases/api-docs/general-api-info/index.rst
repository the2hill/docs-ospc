General API information
=======================

The information in this section is relevant to all operations of the API.
For details about specific operations, see the
:ref:`API reference <api-reference>`.

The |apiservice| is implemented using a RESTful web
service interface. Like other Rackspace Cloud services, this service
shares a common token-based authentication system that allows seamless
access between products and services.

.. note::

    All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using
    HTTPS on TCP port 443. For authentication instructions, see
    :ref:`Authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud <authenticate-to-cloud>`.
