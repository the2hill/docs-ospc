.. note::

  Scheduled backups are not available in the SYD and HKG regions.

Cloud Databases allows you to create a schedule for running a weekly
backup for your database instance. There is an incremental backup run at
the end of every day and a full backup is run on the day as defined by
the backup schedule. The backup can always be restored to a new database
instance.Â For details, see :ref:`post-restore-backup-version-accountid-instances`.

All backups will be stored in Cloud Files and will be charged a fee for
Cloud Files.

..  note::

  Any user calling the scheduled backup operations for Cloud DB will need
  access to Cloud Files.

Supported datastore versions for Scheduled Backups are MySQL 5.6, Percona 5.6, and MariaDB 10.
