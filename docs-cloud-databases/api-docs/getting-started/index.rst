Getting started
===============

Use the following information to learn how to authenticate, send API requests,
and complete basic operations by using the |apiservice|.

For more information about Cloud Databases API operations, see the
:ref:`API reference <api-reference>`.

Use the examples to create and access your database instances via
Rackspace Cloud Servers. The examples create a MySQL
database instance. You'll learn how to use the Cloud Databases API by using
the cURL and the trove client command line tools.

.. note::
		You can also access |apiservice| features from the
		`Rackspace Cloud Control Panel`_.
