# GitHub workflow :octocat:

To contribute content to this repository (repo), use the GitHub workflow described here.
To follow the entire contribution process, go to
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Note:** This workflow shows how to make changes to the repo from the command line by using ``git`` commands. If you do not want to use the command line to
manage the workflow, you can use GitHub Desktop or another GitHub GUI.

## Prerequisite

* [Generate SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)

## Workflow

1. Create a fork of this repo.

2. Use the SSH URL for the forked repo to clone it to your local system.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Your-github-username/docs-quickstart.git
    ```

3. Track the upstream repo

    ```bash
    cd docs-quickstart
    git remote add --track master upstream git@github.com:rackerlabs/docs-quickstart.git
    ```
    Start new changes with the following steps.

4.  Bring your branch up-to-date with upstream

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    ```

5. Create a branch for changes. For details about this part of the workflow, see
   [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
   guide.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
    ```

6. In the new branch, make changes to existing files and add new files, as needed.

7. Add all files relevant to the change

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   **Note::** This command is a potentially dangerous command. Consider adding each changed file separately (for example, ``git add <file-name>``), or verify that you really wanted to add every changed file before you commit.

8. Commit the changed files.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "The reason for my change"
    ```

9. Push your branch to your fork
    ```bash
    git push -u origin <name-of-branch>
    ```

10. Create a pull request (PR) to the upstream repo for your branch

    a. Go to https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-quickstart

    b. Click **Create pull request**.

    c. If this PR is related to an outstanding github
       [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-quickstart/issues),
       include a link to that GitHub issue in the PR comment

11. The Information Development team reviews the PR.

12. If necessary, incorporate changes from the review, and update the PR by
    adding more commits.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "The reason for my update"
    git push
    ```
13. Repeat step 12 as needed.

14. Resolve conflicts, if necessary.

    During your review process, someone might have already updated and merged a file that
    you are in the process of changing. . Such a conflict means that you canâ€™t merge your
    PR. To resolve the conflict, perform the following steps.

    a. Bring your branch up-to-date with the upstream repo by running the following
       commands from your branch:

       ```bash
        git fetch upstream
        git rebase upstream/master
       ```

    b. Follow the steps to [resolve a merge conflict from the command line]
       (https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/).

15. After the content is approved and you have resolved any conflicts, the
    Developer Experience team merges the PR.

16. Update your repo

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push
    ```
