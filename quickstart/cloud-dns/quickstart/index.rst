Quickstart for Cloud DNS
========================
Rackspace offers a flexible and scalable solution to DNS management through its Cloud DNS service.

Concepts
========
To use this service effectively, you should understand how these key ideas are used in this context:

domain
    An entity containing all DNS-related information.

zone
    A single manager's scope of control within the domain name space.

.. include:: ../../_common/authenticate.rst

.. include::  samples/authentication.rst

Use the API
===========
Some of the basic operations you can perform with this API are described below.

Zones
-----
You can perform create, read, update, and delete operations on zones. A few of our SDKs use 'domain' to refer to the top-level entity of a DNS entry.

Create zone
~~~~~~~~~~~
The first step in managing your domains and subdomains is to create a DNS zone, which you can think of as being the "root" level.
So, for example, if you have a domain called `example.com`, create a zone called `example.com` via the DNS service as follows:

.. include:: samples/create_zone.rst

Get zone
~~~~~~~~
After you create a zone, you can retrieve it and inspect its details as follows:

.. include:: samples/get_zone.rst

Modify zone
~~~~~~~~~~~
You can modify your DNS zone to change any of the details other than the zone name, so long as the new values are valid.
For example, you can change the zone's email address, but the new address must follow the correct email address format;
you can define a new TTL, but the new TTL must be > 300s.
However, the zone name cannot be changed.
If you need to modify the zone name, delete the zone (explained below) and create another zone with the new domain.

.. include:: samples/modify_zone.rst

Delete zone
~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete a DNS zone:

.. include:: samples/delete_zone.rst

**WARNING: deleting a zone will also delete all the records within it. Please use with care.**

Records
-------
You can perform create, read, update, and delete operations on records.

Create record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you create a zone, you will normally add at least one record to it so that it will be useful. For example, an `A` record gives the IP address of the domain or a subdomain, while a `CNAME` creates an alias (a *canonical* name) to another record.

To create a DNS zone record:

.. include:: samples/create_record.rst

Get record
~~~~~~~~~~
If the zone has one or more records, you can retrieve them for inspection or manipulation as follows:

.. include:: samples/get_record.rst

Update record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a DNS record:

.. include:: samples/modify_record.rst

Delete record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete a DNS record:

.. include:: samples/delete_record.rst

.. include:: ../../_common/moreinfo.rst
