# GitHub workflow :octocat:

To contribute content to this repository (repo), use the GitHub workflow described here. To follow the entire contribution process, go to
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Note:** This workflow shows how to make changes to the repo from the command line by using git commands. If you do not want to use the command line, you
can use GitHub Desktop or another GitHub GUI instead to accomplish the steps.

## Prerequisite

[Generate SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)

## Workflow

1. Create a fork of this repo.

2. Use the SSH URL for the forked repo to clone it to your local system:

    ```
    git clone git@github.rackspace.com:my-github-username/docs-starter-kit.git
    ```

3. Track the upstream repo:

    ```
    cd docs-starter-kit
    git remote add --track master upstream git@github.com:rackerlabs/docs-SDP.git
    ```
    Start new changes with the following steps.

4.  Bring your branch up-to-date with the upstream repo:

    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    ```

5. Create a branch for changes. For details about this part of the workflow, see
   [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
   guide.

    ```
    git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
    ```

6. In the new branch, make changes to existing files and add new files, as needed.

7. Add all files relevant to the change:

   ```
   git add .
   ```

8. Commit the changed files:

    ```
    git commit -m "The reason for my change"
    ```

9. Push your branch to your fork:

    ```
    git push -u origin <name-of-branch>
    ```

10. Create a pull request (PR) to the upstream repo for your branch:

    a. Go to https://github.rackspace.com/IX/docs-starter-kit.

    b. Click the **Create pull request** button.

    c. If this PR is related to an outstanding
      [GitHub issue](https://github.rackspace.com/IX/docs-starter-kit/issues), include a link to that GitHub issue in the comment.

11. The Information Development team reviews your PR.

12. If necessary, incorporate changes from the review, and make updates to your PR by adding more commits:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "The reason for my update"
    git push
    ```
13. Repeat step 12 as needed.

14. Resolve conflicts, if necessary.

    During your review process, someone might have already updated and merged a file that you are in the process of changing. Such a conflict means that you canâ€™t merge your PR. To resolve the conflict, perform the following steps.

    a. Bring your branch up-to-date with the upstream repo by running the following commands from your branch:

       ```
        git fetch upstream
        git rebase upstream/master
       ```

    b. Follow the steps to [resolve a merge conflict from the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/).

15. When content is approved and you have resolved any conflicts, the Information Development team merges your PR.

16. Update your repo:

    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push
    ```
