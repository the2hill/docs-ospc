API |contract version| updates, August 9, 2013
----------------------------------------------

What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

-  The :ref:`update volume <put-update-volume>` operation was added.

-  For the :ref:`create snapshot <post-create-snapshot>` operation, snapshot
   progress was added. The progress is visible in the
   ``os-extended-snapshot-attributes:progress`` field of the snapshot.


Resolved issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed an issue in which the method for creating a volume from a snapshot was
ignoring the ``size`` parameter and was creating a volume the same size as the
snapshot. Now the volume size must be greater than the snapshot size.

Known issues
