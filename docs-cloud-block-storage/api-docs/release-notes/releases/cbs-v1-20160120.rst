API |contract version| updates, January 20, 2016
------------------------------------------------


What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

The ability to create volumes on a different node or rack than existing volumes
was added. Use the ``metadata`` parameter in the body of the request, and
specify ``different_node`` or ``different_rack`` with a comma-separated list of
volume IDs from which you want the volume that you are creating to be distinct.
For example, specifying the following parameters in the request body creates a
volume on a rack that is different from the three specified volume IDs:

``“metadata”: “different_rack=45c2c5c4-2666-43e9-aa6b-e58eb733410b,
8d472323-196d-47bf-8f17-a21b978d0f90,f158d108-aa30-4609-9d31-c2b230f8a871”``

Note that if the criteria specified with ``metadata`` cannot be met, the volume
will be in an error state.

See the :ref:`create volume <post-create-volume>` operation for this addition.
