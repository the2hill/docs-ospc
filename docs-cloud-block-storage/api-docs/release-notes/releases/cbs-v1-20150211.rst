Resolved issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed a bug in Cloud Block Storage that was introduced in the
Cinder Volume Manager deployments on January 27, 2015, and January 29, 2015.
When ``size="100"`` was used for the create volume operation, the value was
not properly converted to an integer. This issue resulted in a response
code of 400.
