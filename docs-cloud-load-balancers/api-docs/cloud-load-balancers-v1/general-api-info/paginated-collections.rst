Paginated collections
=====================

.. COMMENT: Adapt this topic to provide information that is relevant for your

To reduce load on the service, retrieve operations return a maximum limit of
100 items at a time. If a request supplies no limit or one that exceeds the
configured  default limit, the default limit is used instead.

This behavior is called *pagination*. Pagination gives you the ability to limit
the  size of the returned data and to retrieve a specified subset of a large
data set.  Pagination has two key concepts: limit and marker.

* *Limit* is the restriction on the maximum number of items for that type that
  can be returned.

* *Marker* is a reference to an object's ID and is in the list of paged results
  for a particular resource. For example, if the resource is a load balancer,
  the marker is the load balancer ID at which to begin the list of the paged
  results.

To navigate the collection, you can set the ``limit`` and ``marker`` parameters
in the URI. For example, ``?limit=10&marker=1234`` displays a maximum of 10
load balancers in the paginated results, beginning with the load balancer whose
ID is 1234.

You can also use the ``offset`` parameter, which is a count of the number
of objects from where the paginated list is started.

If a marker beyond the end of a list is given, an empty list is returned.
