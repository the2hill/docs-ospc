What's new
-----------

- Feature: Cipher profile support

  - Load balancers with SSL termination are now assigned a cipher profile to control the set of ciphers enabled for
    secure communication between clients and the load balancer.
  - By default, load balancers are assigned a cipher profile named ``default`` which is managed by Rackspace and updated
    from time to time to disable ciphers that have become insecure. For this reason, use of the ``default`` cipher
    profile is recommended.
  - Other profiles are added and managed by Rackspace. As security concerns change, new cipher profiles may be added.
    Included with this release is the availability of the ``CLBCipherPolicy2017-08`` cipher profile which currently
    matches the ``default`` profile with the exception of disabling the ``SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA`` cipher.
    Rackspace security experts have determined the aforementioned cipher is still secure for use with Cloud Load
    Balancers due to maximum lifetime of requests but due to being downgraded from a "high" to "medium" strength cipher
    will be removed from the ``default`` profile in the near future. However, if you would like to disable it now you
    can leverage this new feature and the ``CLBCipherPolicy2017-08`` profile to have it disabled on your load balancers
    immediately.
  - You can find the latest list of available cipher profiles and the ciphers they enable in the
    :ref:`Ciphers <ciphers>` section.

- Feature: List enabled ciphers

  - For load balancers with SSL termination enabled you can use the API to retrieve the list of ciphers enabled.
    See :ref:`List ciphers <get-list-configured-ciphers>`.
