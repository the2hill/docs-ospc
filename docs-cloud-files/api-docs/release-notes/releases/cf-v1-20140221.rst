API |contract version| updates, February 21, 2014
-------------------------------------------------

What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

The following object methods have been updated to include the
``X-Detect-Content-Type`` header in the request:

-  **PUT** (:ref:`create or update object <create-or-update-object>`)

-  **POST** (:ref:`update object metadata <create-or-update-object-metadata>`)

-  **COPY** (:ref:`copy object <copy-object>`)

If you set this header to ``True``, the ``Content-Type`` that is sent
in the request (if any) is ignored, and the ``Content-Type`` is determined
by using the Python mimetypes library based on the object path.
