What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

-  CDN URLs have been changed to enhance the scale and security of the CDN.
   Previously existing URLs continue to work as new URLs are rolled out.

-  The time to live (TTL) maximum has been refreshed to one year. Previously
   set TTLs for existing objects in the CDN continue to work as the new limit
   is rolled out for new objects.

Resolved issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed static web error handling. Create a custom error page for your
users so that they don't get generic, unbranded error pages like 404
pages.
