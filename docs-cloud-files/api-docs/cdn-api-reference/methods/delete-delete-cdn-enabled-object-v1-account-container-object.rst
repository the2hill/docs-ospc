Delete CDN-enabled object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    DELETE /v1/{account}/{container}/{object}

This operation purges an object from the CDN.

When you find it necessary to remove a CDN-enabled object from public access
before the TTL expires, you can perform a ``DELETE`` operation against the
object, or you can create a support ticket to purge the entire container.

To delete containers that have been CDN-enabled in the past and are now
disabled, but are still showing up when you use the
:ref:`List CDN-enabled containers<list-cdn-enabled-containers>` operation, send
a DELETE request with an ``x-remove-cdn-container: t`` header to remove them
from the listing.

.. warning::
   You request this operation against a CDN management services URI, such as
   ``https://cdn2.clouddrive.com/v1/MossoCloudFS_aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee``/,
   as shown in the table “Regionalized service endpoints for CDN management
   service” in the :ref:`Service Access endpoints <service-access>` section. If
   you use a Storage management services URI by mistake, you delete your
   object.

.. note::
   You should limit object purges to situations in which serious personal,
   business, or security consequences could occur if the object remained
   publicly accessible on the CDN (for example, when someone publishes your
   company's quarterly earnings too early).

You can purge objects from the CDN in the following ways:

**By using DELETE in the API**

You can manually purge CDN-enabled objects without having to wait for the TTL
to expire, and you can optionally be notified by email that the object has been
purged.

You can use the ``DELETE`` operation against a maximum of 25 objects per day by
using the API.

An attempt to delete more objects results in a 498 (Rate Limited) status code.

Here is an example response for hitting the purge rate limit:

.. code::

   $ curl -i -XDELETE -H'x-auth-token: f064c46a782c444cb4ba4b6434288f7c' https://cdn1.clouddrive.com/v1/MossoCloudFS_0672d7fa-9f85-4a81-a3ab-adb66a880123/MyContainter/MyObject
   HTTP/1.1 498 Rate Limited
   Content-Length: 42
   Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

**By creating a support ticket to purge an entire container**

The 25-object limit does not apply when purging an entire container through
Support.

.. note::
   To prevent the container from going back to the CDN, first change the
   ``X-CDN-Enabled`` flag to ``False`` as shown in
   :ref:`CDN-enable and CDN-disable a container <put-cdn-enable-and-cdn-disable-a-container>`.


The system purges the object from the CDN and sends an email to the indicated
address or addresses. If you want to notify more than one person about the
deletion, you can enter a comma-separated list of addresses. The email address
is optional.

A status code of ``204 (No Content)`` indicates success. Status code
``498 (Rate Limited)`` indicates that the account has reached its 25 object
daily purge limit for CDN-enabled objects. Status code ``403 (Forbidden)``
indicates that an authorization problem occurred.

Because there are so many edge servers around the world, purging objects might
take a long time. Be patient while waiting for a response.
