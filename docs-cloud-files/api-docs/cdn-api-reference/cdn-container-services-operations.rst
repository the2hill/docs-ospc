CDN container services operations
=================================

You can perform the operations described in the section on CDN-enabled
containers in your Cloud Files account.

When you CDN-enable a container, all the objects within it become available on
the CDN. Similarly, after a container is CDN-enabled, any objects added to it
through the storage service become CDN-enabled. After you CDN-enable a
container, its publicly-available URI can be found with the header X-Cdn-Uri,
and its objects can be accessed with X-Cdn-Uri/objectName. By knowing this
pattern, you can pre-generate the URI for an object before it is added to the
container.

When you enable a container in the CDN service, you automatically generate URIs
for SSL and streaming usage. They are listed under the X-Cdn-Ssl-Uri and
X-Cdn-Streaming-Uri/X-Cdn-Ios-Uri headers. 

**Note:** X-Cdn-Streaming-Uri and X-Cdn-Ios-Uri streaming links will be discontinued on July 31, 2022.

On August 13, 2012, the format of new CDN URIs changed in order to enhance the
security of the CDN. Any URIs set in the older format
(for example, ``http://c25810.r10.cf1.rackcdn.com/mydog.jpg``) continue to work.
However, any newly generated CDN URIs have the new format, as shown in the
following example:
``http://80745c48926cd286a5a0-48261ebe0e4c795a565ece6b9cca2fe8.r10.cf1.rackcdn.com/mydog.jpg``.

.. note::
   Monitor your CDN charges. When you CDN-enable a container, not only can
   anyone view it, but anyone can link to it. We recommend that you monitor
   your bandwidth usage and charges in the Cloud Control Panel so that you know
   if someone is hot-linking your content. For instructions about viewing your
   usage charges, see
   :how-to:`Protect your Cloud Files CDN Bill from Unexpected Usage<protect-your-cloud-files-cdn-bill-from-unexpected-usage>`.

The examples in this section use sample values for the following:

- account — for example, MossoCloudFS_0672d7fa-9f85-4a81-a3ab-adb66a880123

- X-Auth-Token — for example, f064c46a782c444cb4ba4b6434288f7c

- container — for example, MyContainer

For your own requests, you must use your own account information,
authentication token, and container names. (For more information, see the
authentication section.) Your authentication token and your account information
are in the service catalog that is produced.
