Create and manage object storage
--------------------------------

You can use the simple examples in the following sections for basic Cloud Files
requests that you will commonly use. Example requests are provided in
cURL, followed by the response.

..  note::
    Generally, each time ``curl`` is invoked to perform an operation, a
    separate TCP/IP and SSL connection is created and then discarded. The
    language APIs, in contrast, are designed to reuse connections between
    operations and therefore provide much better performance. We recommend
    that you use one of the language APIs in your production applications
    and limit cURL to testing and troubleshooting.

Before running the examples, review the :ref:`Cloud Files concepts<concepts>`.

.. note::
     These examples use the ``$API_ENDPOINT``, ``$AUTH_TOKEN``, and
     ``$TENANT_ID`` environment variables to specify the API endpoint,
     authentication token, and account ID values for accessing the service.
     Make sure you
     :ref:`configure these variables<configure-environment-variables>` before
     running the code samples.

For more information about all Cloud Files operations, see the
:ref:`Storage API reference <storage-api-reference>` and the 
:ref:`CDN API reference <cdn-api-reference>`.
