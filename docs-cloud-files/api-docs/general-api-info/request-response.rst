Request and response types
==========================

You specify the request format by using the ``Content-Type`` header. The
Cloud Files API supports both the JSON (``application/json``) and XML
(``application/xml``) data serialization formats, as well as other
formats such as ``text/plain``, ``text/xml``, and ``text/html``, along
with ``video``, ``audio``, and ``image`` types. For pseudo hierarchical
folders and directories, ``application/directory`` might be used.

You specify the response format in requests by using the ``Accept``
header. The Cloud Files API supports both the JSON
(``application/json``) and XML (``application/xml``) data serialization
formats, as well as other formats such as ``text/plain`` and
``text/xml``.
