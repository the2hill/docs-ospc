Copy object
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    COPY /v1/{account}/{container}/{object}

Using the ``Destination`` header, copies an existing object to another object
with a new name in the Cloud Files storage system.

The new object can be in the same container, but have a different name from the
original object. Or, the new object can have the same or a different name and
be located in a different container than the original object.

.. note::
   You can use a ``PUT`` operation with the ``X-Copy-From`` header to
   accomplish the same operation as the ``COPY`` operation. The ``PUT``
   operation always creates a new object. If you use this operation on an
   existing object, you replace the existing object and metadata rather than
   modifying the object.

Suppose you upload a file with the wrong object name or content type, or you
need to move some objects to another container. Without a server-side object
copy feature, you would need to repeat uploading the same content and then
delete the existing object. With a server-side object copy feature, you can
save the step of re-uploading the content and thus also save the associated
bandwidth charges, if any were to apply.

You can send a ``COPY`` request to the existing object and include the
``Destination`` header to specify the destination of the copy. The header value
is the container and new object name in the form of ``/container/object``.
Unlike using the ``PUT`` request, this approach does not require a
``Content-Length`` header.

**Example: Copy object approach 1 - using COPY**

.. code::

   COPY /v1/account/sourceContainer/sourceObject  HTTP/1.1
   Host: storageURL
   X-Auth-Token: yourAuthToken
   Destination: /destinationContainer/destinationObject

Alternatively, you can send a ``PUT`` request to the location of the new object
(the destination), and add the ``X-Copy-From`` header to designate the source
of the data. The header value must be the container and object name of the
source object in the form of ``/container/object``. The HTTP specification of a
``PUT`` request with the ``X-Copy-From`` header requires a ``Content-Length``
header, but the storage system does not use the ``Content-Length`` value to
perform the operation. For this reason, you can simply send a
``Content-Length`` value of 0 (zero).

.. note::
   By default, you cannot copy an object larger than 5 GB. For information
   about how to handle objects larger than 5 GB, see
   :ref:`Creating large objects <creating-large-objects>`.

**Example: Copy object approach 2 - using PUT**

.. code::

   PUT /v1/account/destinationContainer/destinationObject  HTTP/1.1
   Host: storageURL
   X-Auth-Token: yourAuthToken
   X-Copy-From: /sourceContainer/sourceObject
   Content-Length: 0

With both of these approaches, the destination container must exist before you
copy the object.

.. note::
   If you are copying many objects, you can improve the total copy time by
   issuing several concurrent ``COPY`` commands. Because Cloud Files is a
   distributed storage system, your concurrent ``COPY`` commands run on
   separate machines simultaneously. As a best practice, you can run up to
   100 concurrent ``COPY`` commands per container.

If you want to move the object rather than copy it, send a ``DELETE`` request
to the source object after copying it. A move is simply a ``COPY`` operation
followed by a ``DELETE`` operation.

All metadata is preserved during the object copy. Note that you can set
metadata on the request to copy the object (with either ``PUT`` or ``COPY`` ),
and the metadata overwrites any conflicting keys on the destination object.

Your account is not charged when you copy or move your objects within the same
data center by using the internal network URI, ServiceNet, as the storage URL.
You can find your ServiceNet endpoint in the service catalog that is created
when you authenticate your session. For information about how to authenticate
your session, see
:ref:`Authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud <authenticate-to-cloud>`. As shown in
the following partial service catalog example, the ServiceNet URI is listed as
``internalURL``. The name is your Cloud Files storage URL with ``snet-``
prepended to it. If you do not know which data center you are working in, you
can find it in the Cloud Control Panel. (For more information about service
access endpoints, see :ref:`Service access endpoints <service-access>`.)
