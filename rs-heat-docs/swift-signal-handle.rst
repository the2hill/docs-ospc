===================================
 SwiftSignal and SwiftSignalHandle
===================================

Brief summary
=============

SwiftSignal can be used to coordinate resource creation with
notifications/signals that could be coming from sources external or
internal to the stack. It is often used in conjunction with
SwiftSignalHandle resource.

SwiftSignalHandle is used to create a temporary URL and this URL is used
by applications/scripts to send signals. SwiftSignal resource waits on
this URL for a specified number of signals in a given time.

Example template
================

In the following example template, we will set up a single node Linux
server that signals success/failure of user_data script
execution at a given URL.

Start by adding the top-level template sections:

.. code:: yaml

Resources section
-----------------

Add a SwiftSignalHandle resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SwiftSignalHandle is a resource to create a temporary URL to receive
notification/signals. Note that the temporary URL is created using Rackspace
Cloud Files.

.. code:: yaml

      signal_handle:
        type: "OS::Heat::SwiftSignalHandle"

Add SwiftSignal resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SwiftSignal resource waits for a specified number of "SUCCESS" signals (number
is provided by the ``count`` property) on the given URL (``handle`` property).
The stack will be marked as a failure if the specified number of signals are
not received in the given ``timeout`` or if a non "SUCCESS" signal is received such as a "FAILURE". 
A data string and a reason string may be attached along with the success or failure notification. 
The data string is an attribute that can be pulled as template output. 

.. code:: yaml

      wait_on_server:
        type: OS::Heat::SwiftSignal
        properties:
          handle: {get_resource: signal_handle}
          count: 1
          timeout: 600

Here SwiftSignal resource would wait for 600 seconds to receive 1 signal
on the handle.

Add a Server resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a Linux server with a bash script in the ``user_data`` property. At
the end of the script execution, send a success/failure message to the
temporary URL created by the above SwiftSignalHandle resource.

.. code:: yaml

      linux_server:
        type: OS::Nova::Server
        properties:
          image: 4b14a92e-84c8-4770-9245-91ecb8501cc2
          flavor: 1 GB Performance
          user_data:
            str_replace:
              template: |
                #!/bin/bash -x
                # assume you are doing a long running operation here
                sleep 300

                # Assuming long running operation completed successfully, notify success signal
                wc_notify --data-binary '{"status": "SUCCESS", "data": "Script execution succeeded"}'
                
                # Alternatively if operation fails a FAILURE with reason and data may be sent,
                # notify failure signal example below
                # wc_notify --data-binary '{"status": "FAILURE", "reason":"Operation failed due to xyz error", "data":"Script execution failed"}'
                
              params:
                # Replace all occurances of "wc_notify" in the script with an
                # appropriate curl PUT request using the "curl_cli" attribute
                # of the SwiftSignalHandle resource
                wc_notify: { get_attr: ['signal_handle', 'curl_cli']

Outputs section
---------------

Add swift signal URL to the ``outputs`` section.

.. code:: yaml

      #Get the signal URL which contains all information passed to the signal handle
      signal_url:
        value: { get_attr: ['signal_handle', 'curl_cli'] }
        description: Swift signal URL
      
      #Obtain data describing script results. If nothing is passed, this value will be NULL 
      signal_data:
        value: { get_attr: ['wait_on_server', 'data'] }
        description: Data describing script results
        
      server_public_ip:
        value:{ get_attr: [ linux_server, accessIPv4 ] }
        description: Linux server public IP
