Listing public IP addresses for a cloud server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you have obtained your authentication token, you can use the
RackConnect API to list all public IP addresses that apply to a specific
cloud server.

The following example shows how to issue a **GET** request that lists
all the public IP addresses that pertain to a specific server that has
been set up for a specific tenant.

**cURL list all public IP addresses request**

.. code::

    curl --include \ 
    --request GET \
    --header "X-Auth-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    $API_ENDPOINT/v3/$TENANT_ID/public_ips?cloud_server_id=serverUuid


.. note:: You can obtain the UUID (universally unique identifier) of your cloud
   server from within its server details page in the `Cloud Control
   Panel <https://login.rackspace.com>`__ or with the `Cloud Servers
   API—Get Server Details <https://docs-ospc.rackspace.com/cloud-servers/v2/developer-guide/#get-list-servers-with-details-servers-detail>`__
   operation. The UUID is a 32-character entry with four hyphens in the
   **ID** or **id** section of the server details page.

The following example shows a successful response for a cloud server
that has a public IP address assigned.

.. code::

      {

       "cloud_server":
         {
           "cloud_network":
