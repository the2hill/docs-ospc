===================
Load balancer pools
===================

Load balancer pools must be configured in advance by your Network Security team
to be eligible for use with RackConnect. If you do not see a pool that you expect
to see, contact your Support team for assistance.

The `load_balancer_pool_id` returned by these calls is automatically generated by
the RackConnect automation and remains constant unless the load balancer pool
is renamed on your hardware load balancer.

All load balancer pools currently return a status of ACTIVE. Future features might
introduce additional statuses.
