Limits
~~~~~~~

All accounts are configured with default thresholds, or limits, that
manage capacity and prevent abuse of the system.

Each of your cloud servers is limited to making 30 requests per minute.
If a server exceeds the number of allowed requests per minute, you will
receive an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) response code. The counter resets each
minute.

..  note::
    If the default limits are too low for your particular application,
    contact Rackspace Cloud support to request an increase. All requests
    require reasonable justification.
