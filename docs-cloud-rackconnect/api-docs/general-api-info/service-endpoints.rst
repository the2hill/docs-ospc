Service access endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RackConnect v3.0 API provides the following endpoint for making API
calls.

``https://<region>.rackconnect.api.rackspacecloud.com/v3/<tenantId>``


Replace the ``<region>`` and ``<tenantId>`` placeholders with the region where your
cloud servers are located and your cloud account's tenant ID number,
which is also referred to as your account ID. Your account ID is located
after the final slash (//) in the ``publicURL`` field returned in the
:ref:`authentication service response<review-auth-resp>`.
