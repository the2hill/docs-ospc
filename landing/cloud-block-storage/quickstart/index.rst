==================================
Quickstart for Cloud Block Storage
==================================
Cloud Block Storage provides dependable performance for your I/O-intensive applications by providing a block level storage solution that allows you to mount drives or volumes to your Next Generation Cloud Servers.
The two primary use cases are (1) to allow you to scale your storage independently from your compute resources
and (2) to allow you to utilize high performance storage to serve database or I/O-intensive applications.

You have your choice of SSD or SATA volume types:

SATA
    SATA volumes work well for your everyday file system needs. This is the default volume type.

SSD
    SSD volumes deliver even higher performance for databases and other I/O-intensive applications.

Plus, you don't have to scale up your servers; both standard and SSD volumes work with all sizes of next-generation Cloud Servers.

Concepts
========
To use this service effectively, you should understand how these key ideas are used in this context:

Snapshot
    A point-in-time copy of the data that a volume contains.
    Snapshots are incremental, so each time that you create a snapshot,
    the incremental changes for the new snapshot are appended to the previous snapshot, which is still available.

Volume
    A detachable block storage device.
    You can think of it as a USB hard drive.
    You can attach a volume to one instance at a time.

.. include::  samples/authentication.rst

Use the API
===========
Some of the basic operations you can perform with this API are described below.

Volume operations
-----------------
You can perform create, read, update, and delete operations on volumes.

Create volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a block storage volume in its basic form:

.. include:: samples/create_volume.rst

List volumes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To see a list of all the block storage volumes you have created in a single region:

.. include:: samples/list_volumes.rst

Show volume
~~~~~~~~~~~
To inspect a specific volume's state:

.. include:: samples/show_volume.rst

Update volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a volume's display name and/or description:

.. include:: samples/update_volume.rst

Delete volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete a volume when it is no longer in use (attached) and the data it contains is not needed:

.. include:: samples/delete_volume.rst

Note: please be advised that deleting a volume deletes all the data within it and cannot be recovered unless such data was previously backed up.

Snapshot operations
-------------------
You can perform create, read, update, and delete operations on snapshots.

Create snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a snapshot of a block storage volume:

.. include:: samples/create_snapshot.rst

List snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To see all the snapshots you have created in a given region:

.. include:: samples/list_snapshots.rst

Show snapshot details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To inspect detailed metadata of a specific snapshot:

.. include:: samples/show_snapshot.rst

Update snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a snapshot's display name and/or description:

.. include:: samples/update_snapshot.rst

Delete snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To permanently delete a snapshot:

.. include:: samples/delete_snapshot.rst

.. include:: ../../_common/moreinfo.rst
