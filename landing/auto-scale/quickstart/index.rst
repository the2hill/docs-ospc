Quickstart for Auto Scale
==========================

.. toctree:: :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 2

Rackspace Auto Scale is a service that lets you configure automated scaling of resources 
in response to an increase or decrease in overall workload based on user-defined policies. 
You can set up a schedule for launching Auto Scale or define an event that is triggered by 
Cloud Monitoring. You can also specify a minimum and maximum number of cloud servers, 
the amount of resources that you want to increase or decrease, and the thresholds in 
Cloud Monitoring that trigger the scaling activities.

To use Auto Scale, you define a scaling group consisting of cloud servers and cloud load 
balancers. Then you define policies, either schedule-based or monitoring-based. For 
monitoring-based policies, you define cloud monitoring alerts to watch the group's activity, 
and you define scaling rules to change the scaling group's configuration in response to alerts. For schedule-based policies, you simply set a schedule. Because you can change a scaling group's configuration in response to changing workloads, you can begin with a minimal cloud configuration and grow only when the cost of that growth is justified.

Before beginning to work with Auto Scale,
you should be familiar with
`Cloud Servers </docs/cloud-servers/quickstart/>`_ and
`Cloud Monitoring </docs/rackspace-monitoring/quickstart/>`_.

Concepts
---------

To use this service effectively, you should understand how these key ideas are used in this context:

capability URL
    URL that gives authorization for a certain action or event.
    If you know the URL, you have access to it and you can use the URL to trigger a specific event.
    Capability URLs are usually long and random and cannot be guessed by a user.

scaling group
    Specifies the basic elements of the Auto Scale configuration.
    It manages how many servers can participate in the scaling group.
    It also specifies information related to load balancers if your configuration uses a 
    load balancer. When you create a scaling group, you specify the details for the group 
    configuration and the launch configuration.

scaling policy
    Defines the scaling activity that will take place, as well as when and how that scaling activity will take place.
    You can define a scaling policy to trigger Auto Scale activities through a webhook or based on a schedule.
    You can specify multiple policies to manage a scaling group.

webhook
    Industry-standard protocol for sending events between systems; for Auto Scale, webhoooks are used to execute policies.
    A webhook consists of an HTTP callback that is triggered by some user-defined event,
    such as an alarm that is set through Cloud Monitoring or another monitoring service.
